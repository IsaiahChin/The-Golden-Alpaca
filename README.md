# ✨The Golden Alpaca 🦙

The Golden Alpaca 🦙 is a procedurally generated bullet-hell game.

## 📜 Lore

A long time ago, the land was filled with alpaca's, roaming free and enjoying the world as it was. *Lots of grass.* When **suddenly** a pandemic wiped out the entire earth... All that was left was a secret underground laboratory, said to have contained a single alpaca (*that sparkled*) immune to the pandemic. **YOU** are that alpaca. In order to escape, you must defeat those who stand in your way... Good luck.
